# Coding Learning Repository 🏁
  This repository contains code that I've written as part of my learning process. 
My main purpose in creating this repository is to track my progress, but I also want to use it as part of my portfolio to show my coding skills.

## What's in the Repository 🤔
  So far, this repository contains several scripts that I've written for practice. 
Each script is named based on its topic, and the code is documented to explain what it does.

## How to Use the Code ❓
  Feel free to use this code for your own learning purposes! 
You can clone this repository to your own machine and run the code in your preferred coding environment.

**Keep in mind that I'm still a beginner, so the code here may not be the most optimized or efficient. 
However, I've done my best to write code that is easy to read and understand. 😊

## Contributing ✅
  I'm open to suggestions and feedback on how to improve the code in this repository. 
If you see a mistake or a way to make the code better, feel free to create an issue or submit a pull request.
